          <p>My main job during this project was to map the data collected from each of my group members onto a Bokeh plot with a base
            of google maps. The first aspect that had to be covered in this process was establishing how to lay bokeh over a plot of google
            maps. Once that code was identified, we then had to obtain an API key from Google Maps in order to use Google Maps for this project. 
            Now it was time to break down the data. Kat created a .csv file with everyone's latitude and longitude points for the past week. Connor
            then walked me through how to split the csv file so that we could isolate each person's specific latitude and longitude point so that 
            each group member had a specific set of values. The next step was to then plot all of the location points in different colors so that 
            the user can see what places the five of us frequent the most and which places we each frequent individually. Once that was done, we then
            brainstromed how to make this more interactive than just being able to zoom in.
